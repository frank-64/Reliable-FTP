We all use operating systems and networks every day, every time we use a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, or any number of other computing devices. An ordinary user may not be interested in how the operating system of a device they use works and may not even know the operating system exists. As computer scientists we both should be interested in how they work and need to know how they work. For example, it is not possible to detect and protect against cyber attacks without an understanding of operating systems and networks. If you want to resolve performance or reliability problems, you need an understanding of the role of operating systems and networks.
